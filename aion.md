At the root of the Aion network is a purpose-built, public, blockchain called Aion-1. Designed to connect other
blockchains and manage its own robust applications, Aion-1 also provides the economic system that incentivizes
interoperability in the ecosystem.

However, the widespread adoption of blockchain technology is constrained by unsolved questions of scalability, privacy,
and interoperability.

Core to our hypothesis is the idea that many blockchains will be created to solve unique challenges
within diverse industries.


Aion-1 is a connecting network designed as a trustless software execution platform with a robust cryptoeconomic model
that will:
* Allow the creation of unlimited spokes—custom blockchains that connect with all other Aion network
blockchains and allow users to customize governance, issuance, and participants.
* Provide inter-chain communication of data and value between all connected blockchains in the Aion
ecosystem
* Enable the development of cross-chain dApps that can leverage and execute data and logic across all
connected blockchains
* Allow the seamless movement of Aion coins across native Aion blockchains to signal adoption as major
core protocol upgrades are launched as new Aion blockchains
* Utilize a hybrid delegated consensus model with wide-spread participation through coin staking “stakers”
and participants in the proof-of-intelligence algorithm “solvers”

Phase 1 of Aion network development focuses on launch technologies that will be functional for the first version of the
live system.
The Aion network will:
* Utilize a optimized version of the Equishash proof-of-work algorithm (Equihash2109) while we continue to
design and develop our hybrid consensus system
* Leverage the FastVM, a performance optimized Ethereum VM, for faster and economical contract
execution
* Support a mechanism for AION tokens on Ethereum to flow seamlessly and become native AION coins
